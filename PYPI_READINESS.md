# PyPI release evidence

Assessment date: 2026-11-08 (Asia/Tokyo).

## TommySlate 0.4.1 Beta production release

Version 0.4.1 renames the GitHub repository to
[`natomi1203/tommyslate`](https://github.com/natomi1203/tommyslate), matching
the PyPI distribution name, and changes the development-status classifier from
Alpha to Beta. It does not change runtime behavior, the `safe_slate` import,
the seven registered stable interfaces, or the release artifact policy.

TommySlate 0.4.1 is published on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tommyslate/0.4.1/) and
[TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/tommyslate/0.4.1/). The active Trusted
Publishers on both indexes are bound to repository `natomi1203/tommyslate`,
workflow `safe-slate-release.yml`, and the owner-reviewed `testpypi`/`pypi`
environments. Both environments are restricted to `main`; no long-lived index
token was created.

The frozen source is `ea5745472bc19a536bef3318a2357ff222a20c99`. A
[publication-disabled run](https://github.com/natomi1203/tommyslate/actions/runs/42384926807)
first built and smoke-tested five wheels and one sdist. The approved
[TestPyPI qualification run](https://github.com/natomi1203/tommyslate/actions/runs/42385302459)
published those six files through OIDC, matched every remote SHA-256 to the
manifest, and reinstalled version 0.4.1 on all five target runners.

The approved
[production promotion run](https://github.com/natomi1203/tommyslate/actions/runs/42385996695)
recovered the exact TestPyPI-qualified bundle without rebuilding, verified the
source run and manifest, uploaded through OIDC, matched every production hash,
and reinstalled from PyPI on Linux x86-64 and ARM64, macOS x86-64 and ARM64,
and Windows x86-64.

Production PyPI, TestPyPI, the archived manifest, and the downloaded files all
expose these exact six filenames and SHA-256 values.

## TommySlate 0.4.0 production release

Version 0.4.0 changes only the distribution identity and migration-facing
metadata: users will install `tommyslate`, while Python continues to import
`safe_slate`. The new preferred CLI is `tommyslate-freeze-inputs`; the existing
`safe-slate-freeze-inputs` entry point remains an alias. The stable API and
runtime behavior are unchanged from 0.3.1.

TommySlate 0.4.0 is published on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tommyslate/0.4.0/). Publication used protected
`testpypi` and `pypi` environments and OIDC Trusted Publishing. At release
time, the publisher was bound to the former repository name
`natomi1203/safe-slate-recommender` and workflow `safe-slate-release.yml`; the
repository was subsequently renamed. No long-lived package-index token was
created.

The frozen source is `9594cc0fd96a667cc323a3a8e99b42b04d3100db`. A
[publication-disabled run](https://github.com/natomi1203/tommyslate/actions/runs/42222485659)
first completed all five wheel builds, local installs, smoke tests, sdist build,
metadata checks, and manifest generation.

The approved
[TestPyPI qualification run](https://github.com/natomi1203/tommyslate/actions/runs/42224307122)
then published version 0.4.0 through OIDC, matched all six remote hashes to its
manifest, and reinstalled `tommyslate==0.4.0` successfully on Linux x86-64 and
ARM64, macOS x86-64 and ARM64, and Windows x86-64. The project is available at
[TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/tommyslate/0.4.0/).

The approved
[production promotion run](https://github.com/natomi1203/tommyslate/actions/runs/42233403791)
recovered that exact TestPyPI-qualified bundle without rebuilding, matched all
six production filenames and SHA-256 values, and reinstalled
`tommyslate==0.4.0` successfully on all five target runners.

Production PyPI and TestPyPI expose the same six filenames and SHA-256 values
listed above. The promotion recovered the artifact bundle from qualification
run `42224307122`, verified the run identity, source SHA, manifest, local hashes
and TestPyPI hashes, and uploaded those exact files without rebuilding.

## Version 0.3.1 production release

Version 0.3.1 is published on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/safe-slate-recommender/0.3.1/) from source
commit `342a016d644d72da15f9fc2a8d59a70f6ffda3c2`. The approved
[release workflow](https://github.com/natomi1203/tommyslate/actions/runs/42215206667)
built one source distribution and five wheels, qualified the exact artifacts
on TestPyPI, then uploaded the same files to production PyPI without rebuilding.

Both indexes matched every filename and SHA-256 value in the frozen manifest.
The production package was reinstalled and smoke-tested successfully on Linux
x86-64/ARM64, macOS x86-64/ARM64, and Windows x86-64.

Publication used protected `testpypi` and `pypi` GitHub Environments with OIDC
Trusted Publishing. No long-lived package-index token was created. The first
two Linux x86-64 TestPyPI reinstall attempts observed stale Simple API cache
data; the unchanged workflow succeeded after the cache refreshed, with no
artifact or hash mismatch.
